Ian Tobias is an incoming Assistant Professor in the department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Guelph (January 2024). Dr. Tobias leads the Comparative Neurogenomics Group, which studies the genomics and evolutionary history of nervous system development.

Ian received both his Ph.D. and B.M.Sc. in Physiology and Pharmacology from the University of Western Ontario (UWO) in London, Canada, where he worked with Dr. Dean Betts as a NSERC Canada Graduate Scholar. He completed his Collaborative Specialization in Developmental Biology at UWO where he studied embryonic stem cells and cellular reprogramming. Ian then undertook post-doctoral work in the laboratory of Dr. Jennifer Mitchell at the University of Toronto, where he began work on molecular mechanisms on gene regulation in mammals.
